# Data Science tasks

This repository contains notebooks and code for three tasks:
1) Text classification: given a file with articles' headlines, classify if they are sarcastic or not.
  Techniques tried: 
  - TF-IDF and Logistic Regression
  - word counts and Naive Bayes
  - deep neural network using LSTM and pretrained Glove embeddings
2) Tabular data exploration, cleansing and classification: 
  - analyze corrupted dataset
  - perform necessary cleaning
  - visualize the data 
  - apply a classifier
3) SQL query: 
  given three tables with students' data, their marks and classes taught at the university, 
  write a simple query to find students that scored well on algebra classes.
